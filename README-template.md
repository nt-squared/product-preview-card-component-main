## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I am glad that I could figure out how to make image not scale down when using flex-box

```css
.card-image {
  flex: 1;
  min-width: 50%;
}
```

### Continued development

I find flex-box and SASS very useful, so I want to refine these skills for the future projects.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox and Truncated Text](https://css-tricks.com/flexbox-truncated-text/) - This is an amazing article which helped me the relation between flex-prarent and flex-child. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
